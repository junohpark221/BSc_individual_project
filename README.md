# BSc_individual_project
Final Individual Project for BSc degree<br/>
PYTHON is used for building simulations and Jupyter Notebook is used for data analysis.<br/>

## Overview:
### Title: **Cascading Failure in Interdependent Network**

The aims of this project are building a spatial network model and simulation of the cascading failure on the model.<br/>
To implement the model, the first step is replicating the Buldyrev's model, which is based on the random graph, Erdos-Renyi graph.<br/>
Then, the spatial feature is added in the model. With two models, finding different outcomes bewteen two models and unique features of the spatial network model are introduced in the result of this project.<br/>

## Description of directories
- codes: It contains every version of the models. Not only the final versions of replication and spatial feature models but also the processes of the development are included in this part. The models and simulations parts in this directory are built with PYTHON.
- data analysis: It contains all datasets and analysis of them. All analysis parts are based on the Jupyter Notebook.
- project ideas: It contains the ideas before and during the project.
- The final thesis is also in here.
