# Distance between nodes
  -> 	1. calculate normally
	2. claculate through edge of the layer.
  -> Although case 2 is sufficient, making edge and drawing it does not matter.

# Supporting node from another layer
  ->	Calculate the most nearest node in next layer, and set it in the list of the tuples
  ->	(current node, supporting node)
  ->	If there is not a supporting node, set the tuple as (current node, -1)

# Spatial Attack
  ->	Set the default point as (random, random)
  -> 	Also, calculate the distance as same as finding the distance between nodes
